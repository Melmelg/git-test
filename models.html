          <p>Development work was carried out over a period of 12 months and a prototype model completed a 2,000 mile test, during which no adjustments or alterations were necessary.
          One of the main features of the design was the engine, clutch and 3 speed gearbox, which were housed in a centrally mounted unit. It was coupled to the rear wheel drive by two universal joints. The drive operated the rear wheel through a set of bevel gears. </p>
          <p>The car was fitted with a 10h.p., or 8h.p. J.A.P. engine, Amac carburettor, M.L. magneto and a leather to metal clutch. The initial selling price was £200, which included a spare wheel, hood, screen, horn, lamps, tools, jack and air pump. The first models were put on display in November 1919 and deliveries commenced from early 1920.</p>

          <h3>Variant</h3>
          <p>
            In 1935, an unusual three-wheeled aircraft refueller was successfully introduced for servicing light aeroplanes at civil aerodromes and during World War II many later variants were manufactured for military use. Many continued in use at civil aerodromes and airports in Britain until the 1960s and 1970s with a few still in use (e.g. at North Weald and Leicester East) in the 1990s. At least 20 examples are known to survive worldwide with museums and private owners today. Eventually the company became part of the Northern Engineering Industries Group.
